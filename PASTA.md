## Trinity PASTA ##

_Minor changes to the [IOTA Trinity wallet](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet "Official IOTA Trinity Wallet") that enables pasting of seeds from the clipboard._  

---

_**Study changes before use!**_  
_**Only use PASTA if you anderstand the risks!**_  


### Reasons NOT to use PASTA ###

 - you're fine with dragging and dropping text (yes, you can drag seeds onto Trinity window on most systems).  
 - if your system is infected with malware your seeds may be yanked from the clipboard and sent to Putin!  
 - automatic clearing of clipboard is unreliable across platforms/desktops.  
 - i hate javascript so the code may not be optimal.  

 
### Reasons to use PASTA ###

 - you want to copy/paste a whole bunch of seeds one by one into Trinity (you copy seeds around anyway, don't you?).
 - your system/editor/source does not support dragging of text.
 - it pastes.


### How to use ###

Use Trinity as you would normally, except... you get to paste stuff and lose all your money.  
Invalid seeds cannot be pasted.
